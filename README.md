# Hello Microverse

Hello Microverse is a microservices-based demo application designed to simulate a **Greeting Generation Platform**.  
The goal of this project is to **practice designing, building, and deploying** a distributed system using modern architectural patterns.

---

## **Overview**

The system consists of multiple services that work together to generate personalized greetings for users:

- **Identity Service** â†’ Manages user profiles and language preferences.
- **Template Service** â†’ Manages greeting templates.
- **Greeting Store** â†’ Stores generated greetings.
- **Greeter Orchestrator** â†’ Coordinates the greeting generation workflow.
- **Translator Service (Stub)** â†’ Simulates a flaky external API for translation.
- **Notifier Service** â†’ Simulates notifications when greetings are generated.
- **Audit Service** â†’ Logs system events.
- **API Gateway** â†’ Single entry point for API requests and authentication.
